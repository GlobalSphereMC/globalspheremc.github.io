# **Beginner's Guide**
---
If you haven't played on an Earth server before, GlobalSphere might seem complicated to you. This guide attempts to teach you the basic mechanics of the server.  

If you would like to learn more advanced mechanics, check out the other pages on the wiki!  

# **Joining**
---
This server supports Minecraft: Java Edition (premium) 1.20.6 to latest and Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on the latest version.  

If you are on Minecraft: Java Edition, enter the IP address as `globalsphere.ddns.net:25579`. If you are on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, enter the IP address as `globalsphere.ddns.net` and the port as `25579`.  

At spawn, you have the choice to start at some points on the map. Don't worry, you can access any of these points later by doing `/warp spawn`.

After you have picked a starting location, venture a bit and start playing like a normal minecraft world.  

Be aware that coal, iron, gold, lapis, and diamond ores drop "nuggets" instead of what they usually drop. You can combine 9 nuggets to make the original ore drop.  

# **Towny**
---
You may notice that you cannot build in some places. This is because the server uses the [towny](ee) claiming system, and those areas were claimed by someone. You can either join that person's town, or create your own in a non-claimed place. You can use the [dynmap](http://globalmap.ddns.net) to assist you in this.  

Once you've gotten to a place you want to settle in, you need to get funding for your town. Jobs provide income for doing tasks such as mining. Do `/jobs browse` to see the available jobs on the server. Once you've found a job you like, do `/jobs join <jobName>` to join that job. You can leave the job at any time by doing `/jobs leave <jobName>`. You can have up to 3 jobs at once.  

Once you have $600, you can start your town! Go to the chunk that you want as your "spawn" and do `/t new <townName>`. This will create a new town and claim the chunk you are in. You can do `/t spawn` to get back to your town spawn at any time.

You're not done yet though. Towns have a daily upkeep cost. This is taken from the town bank daily. If you do not have enough money, your town could potentially be deleted! To contribute to the town bank, do `/t deposit <amount>`.

If you want to expand your town, stand in an adjacent chunk and do `/t claim`. Do note that this will take $25 from your town bank.

Towns can also join larger groups called nations. If you are interested in nations, please check out the towny almanac page.

# **Next Steps**
---
So, you're in a town, you have a stable food source, and you got some iron gear. What now?  

Once you get diamonds, you might try to craft diamond gear - but STOP! To reduce grind and turn away pvp sweats, we have disabled diamond combat items like diamond armor, diamond swords, and diamond axes. However, diamond tools (pickaxe, shovel, and hoe) are allowed.  

Netherite gear is also disabled (except for the netherite hoe). But we have a replacement for that: [steel](ee). With steel, you can craft steel gear and rudimentary guns.  

You may have noticed that steel requires ancient debris, which is found in the nether. However, you might try to light a nether portal and find out that we disabled that. So how do you get to the nether?  

The GlobalSphere Intelligence Agency is not sure on the exact method to enter the nether, but there is a rumor...  

If you are interested in entering the nether, you can check out the [Legend of Antarctica Claus](ee) - but that's just a rumor, right?  

# **Tips and Tricks**
---
Here are some tips and tricks for new players on the server:  
- Be nice and respectful to all players
  - This prevents them from wanting to [siege](ee) you.
- Some items are banned to balance the game and make it more realistic to the theme. Do /gs itemban in-game to see the full list of banned items.
- If you make your own town, join a nation. If you are in someone else's town, encourage them to join a nation if they are not already in one.
- Join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/RnVwUZmMY3) for the latest announcements, events, and news reports.
- Look through all of the wiki pages for information about our features (especially steel and brewery)
