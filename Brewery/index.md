# **Brewery**
---
[Brewery](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/brewery) is a plugin that allows users to brew complex drinks. Some of the drinks are alcoholic, which makes you drunk. For some brews, the player can optionally choose to age and/or distill it to increase the quality.  

GlobalSphere has added textures to our Brewery drinks. These are available on both Bedrock and Java editions. To get these textures, you must accept our resource pack when joining the server.  

# **Effects of alcohol**
---
Some drinks have an alcohol level, and when consumed your alcohol level will increase. Alcohol has various effects on players:
- Vomiting
- Scrambling speech
- Difficulty walking
- Fainting (being kicked) at max alcohol level
- Trouble rejoining when very drunk
- Waking up at weird places when rejoining

In addition, drinks can have other negative or positive effects other than these.  

To lower your alcohol level, you can either wait, eat bread, or drink milk.
