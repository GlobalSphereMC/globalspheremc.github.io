# **Brewery**

[Brewery](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/brewery) is a plugin that allows users to brew complex drinks. Some of the drinks are alcoholic, which makes you drunk. For some brews, the player can optionally choose to age and/or distill it to increase the quality.  

GlobalSphere has added textures to our Brewery drinks. These are available on both Bedrock and Java editions. To get these textures, you must accept our resource pack when joining the server.
