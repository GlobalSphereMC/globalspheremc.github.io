# **Antarctica Claus II**
---
## *If you are interested in lore continuity, it is recommended that you investigate [the previous mystery](AntarcticaClaus.html) first. Otherwise, feel free to proceed.*

Strangely, Antarctica Claus reportedly does not live in Antarctica.  

His fortress in Antarctica is merely a way to conceal his actual location.  

Some warriors have gone to look for him. Most of them have never returned.  

The ones that did return looked pale, and spoke very cryptically.  

"He... strong... guardian... ice pyramid... freeze ray.. cold... find him... in the Door to Hell..." was a famous quote from a warrior. He died shortly after.  

Some believed that the Door to Hell was his Antarctica base, but nothing out of the usual was found there.  

Our top geography professors at the GlobalSphere Intelligence Agency are trying to find the "Door to Hell", but so far there has been little success.
