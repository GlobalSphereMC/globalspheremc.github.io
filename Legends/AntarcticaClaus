# **The Legend of Antarctica Claus**
---
Everyone knows about Santa Claus, but have you heard of Antarctica Claus?  

Apparently he had a fortress in... Antarctica.  

A long time ago, they wronged him. They censored by GlobalSphere Intelligence Agency. He began to feel hatred for the Empire of the North Pole. Vindicated, he went directly opposite and began to build an evil empire.  

His fortress is also known as "Frozen Hell" to some, and a long time ago some kid made rumors about the actual entrance to hell being there. But that's just a rumour...
