# **Regiments**
---
Some trims have been replaced by military uniforms.  

You can buy these trims at a shop at spawn and apply them to your gear!  

To apply for a regiment, you must be the king of a nation. Open a ticket on the discord and post the picture of the skin you want the regiment to be based off of. The admins may modify the skin (e.g. making the face visible), and they may deny your request for any reason. Nations can have at most one regiment.  

**NOTE: Only steel armor may have a regiment applied to it, so if you see someone wearing a regiment, they are wearing steel armor.**

For the full list of regiments and what trims they use, check out the discord server.
