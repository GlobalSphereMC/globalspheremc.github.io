# **Nations**
---
Nations are groups of towns. One of the towns is the capital. The mayor of the capital is the king of the nation.  

To create a nation, do `/n new <name>`: this costs money. Just like towns, nations also have a bank and require upkeep to be paid. You can do `/n deposit <amount>` to deposit money in your bank.  

To invite a town to your nation, do `/n add <townName>`. Towns can leave a nation at any time if the mayor does `/n leave`.  

You can add other nations as allies by doing `/n ally add <nationName>`. You can remove allies by doing `/n ally remove <nationName>`. Allies can help each other in wars.  

Being in a nation allows the "nation" and "ally" permissions to be used in towns and plots.  

# **Prices**

As a reminder, you can see prices in-game by doing `/towny prices`.
