# **Plots**
---
Plots are chunks that can be in a town. For chunk claiming instructions, please read the "Towns" section.  

Residents in a town can also claim plots as their own. To do this, the plot owner (usually the town/government) must do `/plot forsale <price>`. To take a plot off of the market, do `/plot notforsale`. While a plot is for sale, a resident can claim it by doing `/plot claim`. If you want to kick someone off of a plot, you can do `/plot evict`.  

If you want non-residents to be able to claim a plot, you have to do an extra step. Do `/plot set embassy`, and then put the plot for sale. The claiming system is the same as before.  

You can give multiple people permissions without giving them plot ownership. You can do this by doing `/plot trust add <username>`. You can remove plot trust by using `/plot trust remove <username>`. Be careful, as giving plot trust allows building and destruction permissions for the entire plot.  

Do `/plot set` for more settings.
